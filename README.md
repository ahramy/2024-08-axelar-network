# Additional context

## Main invariants

- Security: Identify and mitigate vulnerabilities to prevent exploits and attacks.
- Reliability: Ensure the contract behaves consistently under various conditions.
- Efficiency: Verify that the contract performs optimally without unnecessary gas consumption.
- Correctness: Ensure the smart contract logic correctly implements the intended functionality without errors.


## Attack ideas (where to focus for bugs)
**Security Concerns - Access Control, Signature Verification, Reply Protection, Data integrity**
- Does the access control mechanism correctly restrict access to sensitive functions?
- Are role-based access controls (onlyRole) correctly implemented for managing flow limiters and operator roles?
- Does the storage function correctly reference the intended storage slots and ensure security?
- Can the signature verification function correctly verify the required signatures?
- Does the function handling signature proofs properly reject invalid or malicious proofs?
- Can the message validation function correctly update the message status to prevent replay attacks?
- Does the message approval function properly check if a message has already been approved to avoid double approvals?
- Are token details, such as addresses and flow limits, securely managed and protected from tampering?
- Does the contract ensure that minting and burning of tokens are properly authorized and logged?
- Any misbehavior by the token which identified through its token ID, does not impact other tokens registered by ITS?

**Functional Concerns - Message Approval and Execution, Signer Rotation, Event Emission**
- Can the message approval functions correctly handle and store message approvals?
- Does the message validation function accurately validate messages and update their status?
- Does the signer rotation function correctly handle signer rotation, enforce the minimum rotation delay, and prevent rotation to duplicate signers?
- Can the signer rotation function address potential edge cases and ensure proper updates to the signer set?
- Does the contract emit all necessary events correctly and include appropriate data?
- Can event emissions avoid inadvertently exposing sensitive information?

**Upgradability Concerns - Upgrade Mechanism, Storage Compatibility**
- Does the upgrade mechanism correctly delegate calls to the implementation contract?
- Can the initialization and upgrade functions handle scenarios without introducing vulnerabilities?
- Does the storage layout remain compatible with future upgrades to prevent data corruption or loss?
- Can the storage structures be correctly defined and used?

**Potential Edge Cases - Error Handling, Gas Efficiency**
- Does the contract have proper error handling and revert statements for invalid inputs, unauthorized access, and other potential failure scenarios?
- Can the contract be optimized for gas efficiency, particularly in loops and storage access patterns?
